# Delivery mechanisms for landing zones

Like in any DevOps approach, you need to have:

- A short feedback loop: on your laptop, you can author new landing zones and test them very fast.
- A set of CI/test pipelines: You commit your test code and validate syntax/features.
- A set of production pipelines: enforcing configuration for the production environment.  

The toolset is vital here, the more discrepancies you will have between your laptop and the CI/CD pipelines, the more time you will waste troubleshooting business-irrelevant problems (wrong versioning, wrong configuration, etc.)

For that reason, the "rover"  which is part of the fundamental toolset of the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework landing zones, enables that integration. More details on the rover here ()
